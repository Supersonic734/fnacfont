		<h2>Jeremiah</h2>
		<br>
		<p>Jeremiah is probably the easiest person to take care of for the first few nights, but as the nights go on, he gets quicker. On night one Jeremiah doesn't come out of his room till a little after 1:00 AM, and moves pretty
		slow. Something that helps you know when Jeremiah is on the move, is his goose noise.  If you look at the minimap whilst in the cameras, you can see where you are, and the two enterences into that room from inside the house, if you see Jeremiah near one of those enterences and then when he moves again, you can't find him
		in the cameras, he's most likely at your door. Be quick though, cause if he is at your door for 6 seconds without you shutting it on him, he will get you.
